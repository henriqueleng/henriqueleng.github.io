My name is Henrique Lengler,

I have a Bachelor's degree in physics, and I live in Viam√£o, Brazil.

I am mainly  interested in different fields of theoretical physics, pure and 
applied math.

I have very different hobbies. I love listening to classical music, 
especially Bach. When I'm not reading scientific books, I like to read
philosophy books, especially Plato and Socrates dialoges. In literature
I am a big fan of Greek epic poems Odissey and the Iliad.
