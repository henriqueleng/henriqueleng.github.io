My name is Henrique Lengler and I'm an undergraduate student of physics
at UFRGS, Porto Alegre.

I'm interested in different fields of theoretical physics, pure and 
applied math.

I have very different hobbies. I love listening to classical music, 
especially Bach. When I'm not reading scientific books, I like to read
philosophy books, especially Plato and Socrates dialoges, but also 
Nietzsche. In literature I'm a big fan of Greek epic poems Odissey and 
the Iliad.
